Code repository for the study "Learning Curve of Distal Transradial Access (dTRA) in Coronary Intervention". This study is a single-center retrospective observational analysis of 150 consecutive dTRA coronary intervention cases (April-August 2025) performed by an experienced transradial operator. The code implements: 1) Quantitative analysis of dTRA learning curve (success rate, puncture times, operation duration); 2) LASSO logistic regression for screening predictive factors of dTRA puncture failure (e.g., anterior wall puncture technique, BNP, SBP). Key findings: Operators with conventional transradial experience master dTRA after ~75 cases, with success rate stabilizing above 90%. The code is built with R (v4.2.0), following STROBE guidelines and ethical approval (Dongyang People's Hospital)
